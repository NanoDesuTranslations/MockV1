                <p>
                    The mock pages, though not complete, generate content (via JavaScript rather than any back end) and
                    can show how the pages respond to dynamic changes in content.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The mock starts <a href="ChapMock.html?chap=0">here</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Width and images</h2>
                <p>It's been observed that the banner was wider than the image inside.  This is because the original nanodesu translations banner images were 1024px wide,
                    and the width of the banner was bootstrap's default 1170px (on large desktops).  There are two ways of fixing this; here they are for comparison:  
                <ul>
                    <li>We can stretch the image to fit it's container: <a href="ChapMock.html">version A</a>.  This is a simple change to the page, but does require that the image be stretched.
                        Depending on the image, there may be visual artifacts.
                    </li>
                    <li>We can <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize">rebuild bootstrap</a> to reduce the size of the container on large desktops: <a href="ChapMockB.html?chap=1">version B</a>.
                        For maintainability, this requires at least keeping a config.json file checked in in the project and modifying that config rather than modifying bootstrap itself.
                        The "right" way to do this would involve using the less tool to build a customized bootstrap.min.css and incorporating less into our build process for the site. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Aside from technical considerations, there's an aesthetic consideration.  Is it better to read the chapter in the narrower column or in the wider column?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h1>Static example pages</h1>
                <p>The static example pages show formatting, but all content and menus are static.
                Script <b>is</b> required in order to fully enable the menus.</p>
